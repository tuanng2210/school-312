        <p>The Blue Team (Italian: "Squadra azzurra") represented Italy in international contract bridge tournaments, winning sixteen world titles from 1957 through 1975. From 1964 to 1969 and during a 1972 comeback, the team comprised three regular pairs: Walter Avarelli–Giorgio Belladonna, Pietro Forquet–Benito Garozzo, and Massimo D'Alelio–Camillo Pabis Ticci. Eugenio Chiaradia and Guglielmo Siniscalco played in early years; Dano De Falco, Arturo Franco, and Vito Pittalà in late years. The spiritual father, long-time coach, and non-playing captain through 1966 was Carl'Alberto Perroux.  The Italian Blue squad was, without a doubt, the best bridge squad ever. After dominating the bridge world for 15 years, they took a vacation for a few years and came back to win three more Bermuda Bowls and an Olympiad. The fact that these competitions are taking place in Italy made it an ideal time to recognize this outstanding squad.</p>

                The "Blue Team" defeated the "Red Team" in 1956 Italian team trials,
                which gave the club its name. Before that, Perroux had begun plans to
                win European championships and the Bermuda Bowl, dominated by American
                teams. Perroux's side won European titles in 1951, 1956, and 1957, but
                lost the 1951 Bermuda Bowl in Naples to the US. Perroux remained
                confident and prepared for the most effective bridge team ever. The
                triumph came in 1957 when Italy defeated the U.S. in the Bermuda Bowl
                final in New York. Massimo d'Alelio, Walter Avarelli, Giorgio
                Belladonna, Eugenio Chiaradia, Pietro Forquet, and Guglielmo
                Siniscalco played. That was just the beginning—the Blue Team would
                rule for 12 of the next 13 years, interrupted only by a disappointing
                1960 Olympiad. The Blue Team's success relied on novel bidding
                methods, which conservative Americans found odd. Losing teams grumbled
                that Italian bids were partly incomprehensible to Americans, giving
                them an unfair advantage. Belladonna of Rome and his partners played
                Roman club, a "short club" style, while Neapolitans Forquet and
                Chiaradia played strong club. Both systems opened with canapés and
                light bids and comments. In 1960, young, inventive, and cocky Garozzo
                joined the team and developed the Neapolitan system into the Blue
                Club, which became famous worldwide. Blue Team won until 1969, when
                they retired. The Dallas Aces won the 1970 and 1971 Bermuda Bowls
                without the Blue Team. The reformed Blue Team defeated the Americans
                in the 1972 Olympiad, 1973, and 1974 Bermuda Bowls. In 1975, Italy
                defeated the USA again after the Aces dissolved in 1974. USA won the
                Bermuda Bowl and Brazil won the Olympiad in 1976, ending the Blue
                Team's supremacy. After a string of wins, Forquet, Pabis-Ticci, and
                D'Alelio withdrew, and Garozzo and Belladonna played C. Garozzo's
                "Super Precision" Precision Club, C. Wei's. The "Blue Team" won
                despite losing its name. Facchini-Zucchelli's "foot-tapping scandal"
                tainted 1975's win.
